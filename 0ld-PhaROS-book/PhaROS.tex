\chapter{Abstract}\chalabel{abstract}
	
	
ROS Is a open software integration framework for robots that is growing up every day and that it shows several success in its topic which includes commercial applications of robots. 
This time-slice will be oriented to overview how to program our own nodes for ROS In Pharo . Also we will show how much can we exploit our highly dynamic environment in this organic architecture. 
\fwkName{} started early 2012 with at L'Ecole des mines de Douai for a robot for human assistance project (Robulab Project). We started this project trying to put emphasis in the dynamism of Pharo language from the beginning. We are now in a process of stabilising and closing the all the basic functionalities, having support for the last three versions of ROS. 
This talk will provide knowledge about ROS environment, and how to quickly prototype the functionality you want to add on it without much knowledge.

\part{Starting like our ancestors, by example}

I strongly believe in directing teaching by example, and by usage. Then, before go to concepts, architecture and design we will just use what we have at hand.

\input{types/types.tex}

\part{When the boy becomes a man}

At this point, we should have already the base to start to fly a bit without central examples, in order to go a bit faster in conceptual and technical meanings. 	
				
This whole part is about writing your own robotic solutions, from the first image, to the code distribution.

\jack{We should \textbf{really} add an explanation by example of TF in this book. There are lot of things that we can drop, but TF is quite mystic. I will try to reach it by using the donatello example.}
